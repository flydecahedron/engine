#
#		1. Changes Made to Linux
#

#	Added /usr/local/lib to the end of /etc/ld.so.conf
Entityx installs there so this just tells the linker where to look when running
the exe.

#
#		2. Changes Made to Eclipse
#

#	Added SFML, tgui and entityx Libraries to Linker
Go to:
	Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> C++ linker -> Libraries
Then add libraries by their name like "sfml-graphics" (no -l)

#	-std=c++14 flag added to compiler
Go to: 
	Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> C++ Compiler -> Dialect
Then add "-std=c++14" to other dialect flags

#	Enabled parallel builds (-j flag with make)
Go to:
	Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Behaviour tab -> Use parallel build checkbox
	
#	Added eclox from the marketplace
eclox is just a gui front end for doxyfile editing that opens up in eclipse

#	Added Linux Tools plugin for perf profiling
